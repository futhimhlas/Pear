# Apple - look a like site
Hi, welcome to this repo.
In this porject I will attempt to copy the layout of Apples main home page

## Limitations
* The apple font is not available from google fonts therefore I've had to settle for screen snipping images for the headings and using a similar free font from google fonts.
* I found a colour sampler online which I used to try and match up the colours as well as possible, though they may not be an exact match, especially the blue and the red used.
